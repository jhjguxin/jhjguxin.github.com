## No one is coming
Happiness: resilience, optimism, self-faith, sence-meaning, social behavior, helping others
Stop blaming others. Take responsibility of your life.
No one is coming. You are responsible for your life, for your self-confidence, for your self-esteem, for your happiness.
No one is coming. It's up to you to make the most out of this experience.
People are comfortably numb.
Clutivating personal growth, working on the positive.
Idealism and good intentions are not enough to resolve conflict.
